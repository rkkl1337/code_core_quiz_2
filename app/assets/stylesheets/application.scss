// `@import` is a utility that is part of SASS. It allows
// to load CSS modules like `require` for Node JS modules.
// Now that this file has been converted into a SCSS file,
// `@import` must be used instead of //*= require to load
// the contents a file. You can't load an entire directory.
// You'll have to manually import every single SCSS file
// you create.

// The following import loads the SCSS from the
// "bootstrap" gem.
@import "bootstrap";
